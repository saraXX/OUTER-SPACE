<h2 class="wide">DISCOVERY OF SPACE</h2>
<p class="tx">is the ongoing discovery and exploration of celestial structures in outer space by means of
continuously evolving and growing space technology. While the study of space is carried out mainly by
astronomers with telescopes, the physical exploration of space is conducted both by unmanned robotic
space probes and human spaceflight While the observation of objects in space, known as astronomy predates
reliable recorded history, it was the development of large and relatively efficient rockets during the mid-twentieth
century that allowed physical space exploration to become a reality. Common rationales for exploring space include advancing
scientific research, national prestige, uniting different nations, ensuring the future survival of humanity, and developing military
and strategic advantages against other countries</p>

<h3>Titan's Trick Explained: Magic Islands on</br>
 Saturn Moon May Be Bubbles</h3>
<p class="tx">Mysterious bright anomalies known as "magic islands" that wink in and
 out of existence on the seas of Saturn's largest moon, Titan, may be streams
 of bubbles, a new model suggests Such bubbles, each up to more than an inch
 2.5 centimeters wide, might complicate any future missions seeking to explore
 Titan's seas, to the study's researchers said Titan is bigger than the planet Mercury
 making the natural satellite the largest of the more than 60 known moons orbiting Saturn
 It is also the only extraterrestrial body known to regularly support liquid on its surface
with seas and lakes likely made of nitrogen, methane and ethane, researchers have said.</p>

<h3>Astronomers Find Largest</br>
Oldest Mass of Water in Universe</h3>
<p class="tx" >Astronomers have discovered the largest and oldest mass of water ever detected in
 the universe a gigantic, 12 billion year old cloud harboring 140 trillion times more
 water than all of Earth's oceans combined.The cloud of water vapor surrounds a supermassive
 black hole called a quasar located 12 billion light-years from Earth. The discovery shows that water
 has been prevalent in the universe for nearly its entire existence, researchers saidBecause the light
we are seeing left this quasar more than 12 billion years ago, we are seeing water that was present only
 some 1.6 billion years after the beginning of the universe," said study co-author Alberto Bolatto, of the
 University of Maryland, in a statement. "This discovery pushes the detection of water one billion years closer
 to the Big Bang than any previous find."Studying a distant quasar Quasars are the most luminous, most powerful
 and most energetic objects in the universe. They are powered by enormous black holes that suck in surrounding
gas and dust and spew out huge amounts of energy.

<h3>Exotic World Said to Harbor</br>
'Hot Ice'</h3>
<p class="tx" >A Neptune-sized world in a distant solar system orbits very close to its star and might be covered with
 exotic forms of water not naturally found on Earth, scientists say.The finding, to be detailed in an upcomingissue of the journal Astronomy and Astrophysics, marks the first time relatively small planets similar to the
ice giants Uranus and Neptune in our solar system have been found orbiting very close to their stars Prior to this
discovery, only gaseous giants known as "hot Jupiters" were known to inhabit such close stellar quarters First discovered
in 2004, the planet, called GJ 436 b, is about 22 times more massive than Earth. It orbits a diminutive red dwarf star 30
light-years away from us.
