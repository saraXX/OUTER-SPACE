<h1> BLACK HOLE</h1>
<img src="../images/solar-system-1781241_1920 [25900].jpg" alt="the bange" width="600" height="300">
<p>The Big Bang theory is the prevailing cosmologicalmodel for the universe from the earliest known periods through its subsequent large-scale evolution.The model describes how the universe
expanded from a very high density and high temperature state,and offers a comprehensive explanation for a broad range of phenomena, including the abundance of light elements the cosmic microwave
background, large scale structureand Hubble's Law.If the known laws of physics are extrapolated to the highest density regime, the result is a singularity which is typically associated with the
Big Bang. Detailed measurements of the expansion rate of the universe place this moment at approximately 13.8 billion years ago, which is thus considered the age of the universe.After the initial
expansion, the universe cooled sufficiently to allow the formation of subatomic particles, and later simple atoms. Giant clouds of these primordial elements later coalesced through gravity in halos
of dark matter, eventually forming the stars and galaxiesvisible today.</p>
 <p id="demo" style="display:none">Since Georges Lemaitre first noted in 1927 that an expanding universe could be traced back in time to an originating single point, scientists have built on his idea of</br>
cosmic expansion. While the scientific community was once divided between supporters of two different expanding universe theories, the Big Bang and the Steady State theory</br>
empirical evidence provides strong support for the former.In 1929, from analysis of galactic redshifts, Edwin Hubble concluded, that galaxies are drifting apart; this is important</br>
observational evidence consistent with the hypothesis of an expanding universe</p>

<h1> BLACK HOLE</h1>
<img src="../images/hole-862959_1920 [25895].jpg" alt="the bange" width="600" height="300">
<p>A black hole is a region of spacetime exhibiting such strong gravitational effects that nothing not even particles and electromagnetic radiation such as light can escape from inside it
The theory of general relativity predicts that a sufficiently compact masscan deform spacetime to form a black hole.The boundary of the region from which no escape is possible is called
the event horizon. Although the event horizon has an enormous effect on the fate and circumstances of an object crossing it, no locally detectable features appear to be observed In many ways
a black hole acts like an ideal black body, as it reflects no light.Moreover, quantum field theory in curved spacetime predicts that event horizons emit Hawking radiation, with the same spectrum
as a black body of a temperature inversely proportional to its mass. This temperature is on the order of billionths of a kelvin for black holes of stellar mass, making it essentially impossible to observe</b>
 <p id="de" style="display:none">Objects whose gravitational fields are too strong for light to escape were first considered in the 18th century by John Michell and Pierre-Simon Laplace. The first modern solution of general relativity</br>
 that would characterize a black hole was found by Karl Schwarzschild in 1916, although its interpretation as a region of space from which nothing can escape was first published by David Finkelstein in</br>
1958. Black holes were long considered a mathematical curiosity; it was during the 1960s that theoretical work showed they were a generic prediction of general relativity

<h1>CORONAL CLOUD</h1>
<img src="../images/planets-1497200_1920 [25899].jpg" alt="the bange" width="600" height="300">
<p>A coronal cloud is the cloud of hot plasma gas surrounding a coronal mass ejection. It is usually made up of protons and electrons. When a coronal mass ejection occurs, it is the coronal cloud
that usually reaches Earth and causes damage to electrical equipment and space satellites, not the ejection or flare itself. The damage is mostly the result of the high amount of electricity
moving through the atmosphe A coronal cloud is released when a solar flarebecomes a coronal mass ejection; the coronal cloud often contains more radioactive particles than the mass ejection itself
a coronal mass ejection occurs when a solar flare becomes so hot that it snaps and breaks in two, becoming a "rope" of heat and magnetism that stretches between two sunspots. The resulting coronal</p>
 <p id="d" style="display:none">mass ejection can be compared to a horseshoe magnet, the sunspots being the poles and the oscillating magnetic connector the handle. Coronal mass ejections typically do not last very long, because</br>
they cool down as the coronal cloud of gas is released and begins to hurtle away from the sun
